        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Facinated with video games from a very young age, I wished to learn the art of creating my own virtual worlds. Started by learning programming and dissecting the inner workings of many games, then writing my own small game engines and demos. I made the first step toward my dream of joining the industry in 2016, by becoming a games tester and getting my first full time job.</p>
