        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div id="subsection">
            <p>Facinated with video games from a very young age, wishing to learn the art of creating my own virtual worlds. Started by learning programming and studying the inner workings of different games under their hood. I have written few small game engines and many demos since then. I made the first step toward my dream of joining the industry in 2016 by becoming a games tester and later getting my first full time job.</p>
